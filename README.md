# Web Security
Keeping a web server and its applications protected or save from harm. Website are public and high-profile.

## Hacker
Hacker is the individual has technical skills about networking, developement, and creativity to inspect or discover vulnerbility of system. There are two kind of hacker, white hat hacker and black hat hacker.

### White hat hacker
This individual is not harm, they usually a professional network security or ordirary guy with curious about networking and find the vulnerbility so they can reporting to its developer to be fixed.

### Black hat hacker
Dangerous individual with behavior potentially to ruin and broke the system, opposite of white hat hacker, black hat hacker has many reason to do negative things.
* Curious users
* Thrill seekers
* Trophy hunters
* Script kiddies
* Political activist
* Professional

## Zero-day exploits
Security vulnerability known only to hackers, kept secret and traded. Hackers kept that vulnerability as long as posible from developer. Instead developer has had "zero days" of awareness to anticipate the uncovered vulnerability to shut down the vulnerability and make the system more secure before being hacked.

## Security level
Security of our system measured by the lowest of aspect technology that we used. If we have new feature with new technology security level 4 then our security level of overall system is 4 as well. But we don't need 100% secure and it never be achieved. Should match your needs and goals. Let's say we will secure $100 of money, we just lock the door and save the money in home secure box. But if we want to secure $100 million of money, we must pay security guy and most advantage security system and cameras every corner.

## Security mindset
We need everybody in our office aware about vulnerability and security mindset. Maybe IT departement responsible to build standard of security and system but general staff still must have awareness about theirself that can be used to jump over the system to access the vulnerability. We need educate them to do practice of manage of security such as avoid write credentials in sticky note and leave it in their desk so everyone can get access to their computer and do some harm action. Keep in main about security mindset:
* Everyone need to be careful all time
* Weakest link in your security is your level of security
* Average users have to be mindful of security
* Security may require time and money
* Allocate for security in project timeliness
* Take any raised security concern seriously
* Review all technology in use (hardware and software)
* Review code in use and still in development
* Review procedures
* Review access privileges
* Educate and re-educate (remind them periodically about security awareness)

## Security Policy
* Communicates how information assets are protected
* Rule or guidelines
* Keep it simple, clear and easy to follow
* Involve all stakeholders
* Review periodically - security concern changes

## Security Principle
* **Least Privileges**
Controlled data access, easy to test action and identify what action allow and not allowed by user. Vulnerabilities are limited and localized. Every program and every privileges user of the system should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job.

* **Simple is more secure**
Larger and more complex a system, there are possibility having bugs and vulnerability. Break long section code into smaller pieces. Built-in function are often better than your own versions. Disable or remove unused features when possible.

* **Never trust users**
Users can cause problem, avoid human mistake such inputs in web, be paranoid into user behavior. Everyone potential to be hacker, don't even trust admin users completely or ex-employees.

* **Expect the unexpected**
Security is not reactive, we don't wait attack to recover, but we try prevent the attacker to attack. Get creative as user perspective, find out and curious anything to harm our system, such as what happen when user input is too long, contain symbol and high ASCII, ask yourself if it could broken our system and we prevent if it does.

* **Defense in depth**
Having extra security layer or layered defenses to slowing the advance of an attacker. Attacks lose momentum to destroy our system. Defense in depth are people, technology and operation (data handling procedure, monitoring responsibility and how you respond the threat).
